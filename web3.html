    <p> In recent years the attention of the American public has been drawn to the increase in school shootings throughout the country. A very large percentage of the American population sends their children to school or attends a school themself. Therefore this widespread problem has affected the country as a whole and united them under the shared experience of education, an experience most would say should not be put in jeopardy.  </p>
    <p>  The Washington Post has published a database that has kept track of the school shootings since Columbine in 1999. This database has further proved that school shootings have been a consistent problem across the nation, one that needs to be addressed. After Columbine, there has been an increase in gun violence within schools across the country, despite states taking steps to prevent them within their borders.</p>
    <p> Through the first graphic, the states of California, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina stand out amongst the rest in terms of having the most school shootings. Travis Turgeon is a high school history teacher in Malvern, Pennsylvania. However, he previously taught in Houston, Texas. He explains that when training for his teaching job in Texas, safety was a big priority considering their history of gun violence within schools. He furthered his explanation by saying that his public school had a high amount of security in order to combat these issues. After becoming close with seasoned faculty and staff, they were able to provide him with context on how the school has adapted to the changing state of the nation. He said they implemented more safety protocols such as performing practice drills for various situations, enhancing school security, and educating the teachers and students in those moments of panic. </p>
    <p> After a few years teaching in Texas, Turgeon and his wife moved to Pennsylvania where he once again went through a significant amount of training in order to combat gun violence in schools. Pennsylvania has had 14 school shootings since 1999, which leaves them not too far behind Texas with a total of 20. Turgeon made it clear that while being a teacher in the two states was very different, the seriousness around gun violence stayed persistent. He emphasized how in his schools they took the prevention of these events of violence very seriously, but also acknowledged that this was probably not the case across the board. He explained how neighboring schools took this factor less seriously than his school. However, faculty members who are actively aiming for prevention strategies are essential to the protection of students today. Schools need to care deeply about the safety of their children in order to protect them in situations such as these. The problem is ubiquitous, and the data visualization makes that very clear. Although some states experience this more frequently than others, almost every state has had at least one school shooting happen within their borders. </p>

  <p> Another way to analyze The Washington Post data can be observing which states had the most deadly shootings. By analyzing the data, a few more states, different than the ones with the most in number, come into the fold. These include Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Minnesota, and a few more. Many of these shootings happen to be some of the most well known as of today such as Sandy hook, Parkland, and Columbine. However, regardless if they are well known or not, all of these events listed contain a high number of casualties, some as high as 34. These figures point to a bigger problem: not only are these acts of violence occurring, but they are taking the lives of many innocent people. </p>
  <p> This year alone in 2022, there have been 28 people who have died in a school shooting. Innocent young children should be able to go to school without having to worry about this kind of event. These crimes are taking the lives of so many people and have become a real problem within our country. Over 300 people have died from gun violence in schools since 1999. These are 300 lives that were just going through their daily routine: wake up, get dressed, and go to class. A majority of these numbers are under the age of 18. They had their whole lives ahead of them, and it was ripped from underneath them. </p>
  <p> There needs to be meaningful actions taken in order to prevent these acts of violence from occurring in the schools of America. If America values education so much, then they need to take steps in order to protect it. Former elementary school teacher Dawn Labuono agrees that the country as a whole needs to do more in order to protect todayâ€™s school children. Labuono was a teacher at Saint Anastasia Elementary School. She emphasizes how important it is to protect education in all its glory. She explained the joy she once received when she would watch young minds grow in her classroom. The development of the young mind in growing to understand the world around them is essential in order for society to progress. The effects of experiencing a school shooting can cause massive amounts of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Not to mention a withstanding fear to enter school. It will set children behind for life. The Washington Post data put this widespread problem into perspective, and shows that America needs a massive wakeup call. </p>
